1) Importing Data:
Use Pandas library to bring in the data from a CSV file.

2)Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:
Remove any missing or duplicate data.
Ensure data types are correct.

3)Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Calculate basic statistics like mean score.
Make simple plots to understand data distribution.

4)Analyzing Student Performance:
Determine passing rates and average scores.

5)Visualizing Results:
Create easy-to-read charts like bar graphs to show grade distributions.

6)Identifying Trends and Patterns:
Look for trends in scores over time or across different groups.

7)Statistical Analysis:
Use basic statistical tests to compare groups, like genders or grade levels.

8)Machine Learning (Optional):
Split data, train a simple model (like linear regression), and make predictions.

9)Interpreting Results:
Explain what the analysis findings mean in plain language.

10)Conclusion and Recommendations:
Summarize key findings and suggest actions based on the insights gained.

These steps break down the project into easy-to-understand tasks, making it accessible even for beginners in Python.
